# Udacity Deep Learning

# Project Overview
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
In this project you'll be able to implement a fully functional deep neural network using Pytorch to classify dog breeds. If an image of a  human is being implimented it will detect human and what type of dog breed he or she looks like.

# Project Instructions
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.
	git clone https://github.com/DanielsKraus/Pytorch-dog-app.git
	cd Pytorch-dog-app/project-dog-classification

2. Download the dog dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/dogImages. The dogImages/ folder      should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.

3. Download the human dataset. Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location path/to/dog-project/lfw. If you are using a Windows    machine, you are encouraged to use 7zip to extract the folder.

4. Make sure you have already installed the necessary Python packages according to the README in the program repository.
   Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook and follow the instructions.
